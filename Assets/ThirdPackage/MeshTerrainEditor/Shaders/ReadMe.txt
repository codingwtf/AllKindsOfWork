1. Certain MTE shaders are generated in following environment:

* Unity 2021.3.11f1
* Amplify Shader Editor 1.9.1.5
* URP 12.1.7

Enviroment mismatch might cause shader compile errors. If you got any shader errors, please use lastest compatible ASE(Amplify Shader Editor) to regenerate the shader. Then errors should be resolved.
If you still need help, please contact us. See documentation's Support section for contact methods.

2. Shaders with "Experimental" in its name is experimental and is not recommended to use in production, because of their bad performance and incomplete tooling.
